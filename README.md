# Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown private server

A unfinished private server for Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown. Will most likely never be finished due to the actual server software "APlay" being lost.

This server only supports the latest Steam version of the game.

It only supports account creation and login.
